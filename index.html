            New Delhi: Global life expectancy dropped by 1.6 years between 2019 and 2021, a sharp reversal from past improvements, according to research published in The Lancet journal.
            One of the first to fully evaluate demographic trends in the context of the first two years of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the study has published findings, that researchers said, could have implications for health systems, economies, and societies around the world. The findings also included those of an ageing worldwide population.
            
            The study found that life expectancy declined in 84% of countries and territories during this time. This demonstrated the "devastating potential impacts of novel pathogens", the researchers said.

            Places such as Mexico City, Peru, and Bolivia experienced some of the largest drops, the study found</p><br>
            <p>The researchers also found a marked increase in adult mortality rates globally during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, reversing past decreasing trends.

            </p><br>
            <p>However, child mortality continued to drop amid the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit more slowly than in earlier years, with half a million fewer deaths among children under five years in 2021 compared to 2019, they found.

            </p><br>
            The researchers said stark differences in child mortality persisted regionally, with one in every four children who died globally living in South Asia and two in every four children who died living in sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
